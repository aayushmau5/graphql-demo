# Fullstack GraphQL-Apollo + NextJS Demo

A blog site. Made for practicing GraphQL + NextJS concepts.

**Frontend:** NextJS + Apollo-Client

**Backend:** Apollo-Server + MongoDB

**NOTE:** Authentication is JWT based but right now, the client stores the token in a local storage, which I'm gonna fix soon and use cookies instead.
